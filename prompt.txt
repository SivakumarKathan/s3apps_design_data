In order to keep the control myself;
ask my approval before making any changes to the existing code snipets
do follow only the instruction; do not perform more than the ask.

Act as a Senior Python/django Developer follow high standards. 

---------------------###### Step 1 #####---------------------
inorder to develop a django web application;

create a virtual environment
start by setting up the Python environment (activate) and 

install Django in the virtual environment and 
Create requirements.txt with Django latest version

create the Django project:"s3apps_design"

Create app "blogs"
Create a simple home.html page
Create a base template
Create CSS, JS, and other supporting files in static

 #test the Django setup to ensure everything works correctly:
 #Run Migrations to setup the database

 Run the server

---------------------###### Step 2 #####---------------------
add this image "D:\Project\smartselfservices\s3apps_design_01\static\images\S3 Logo.png" as logo inside the left side of navbar

provide the prompt to perform the same by Gemini AI
Prompt:" it appears with a solid background color when used on my website. Please  make the background truly transparent . The goal is to remove the background so only the logo itself remains visible, and save the result as a PNG with transparency preserved. ensure the transparency is maintained when saving the file a, also keep the size as 60px and 80px."

it reduced more space; revert it; The main content to go full width (edge-to-edge)

good; now adjut the logo to the left end
---------------------###### Step 3 #####---------------------
update Nav bar labels as below -
Nav Bar : keep the existing interactive Nav bar (stay on it; i prefer the bg-primary)
		left:	display Logo(S3*.png) & show the text "Apps" -- this is already set & looks good.
		Center: add label "Home, Stories(where blog post to showcase, show few samples), Services ( list Microservices for future releases)"
		right: Login/logout

looks nice ; instead of Center label "Home" - replace it with a home symbol for more attractive look
use this "fa-solid fa-home" instead of Home lable
No, still its not visible, i can see the next two labels


Nice,Home Icon is visible; 
but the bottom is not aligned with other two labels "Home, "Stories,Services". adjust to align bottom as same as "Stories,Services".
increase the font size for this lables "Stories,Services".

right: Login/logout , profile view after login

---------------------###### Step 4 add new pages for Stories & Services #####---------------------
create a simple Stories.html and Services.html  under "templates/blogs" by inheriting the base.html & display some relavent texts
include appropriate links in blogs url & view files for Stories.html and Services.html

in base.htmladjust the navbar-label href url links for navigate to Stories & Services pages
	<a class="nav-link text-white navbar-label" href="#">Stories</a>
	<a class="nav-link text-white navbar-label" href="#">Services</a>

---------------------###### Step 5 #####---------------------
